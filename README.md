## Introduction


Our inaugural Super Protocol Python Competition is now live, providing an opportunity for developers to showcase their AI/ML Python solutions built on the Super Protocol Testnet. The competition is designed to demonstrate the readiness of the Super Protocol Testnet infrastructure to deploy simple apps and solutions.

The Competition is designed for skilled indie developers and AI/ML teams proficient in Python, a novice might find it a bit challenging, though we welcome everyone equally. The competition spans two months from registration to the results announcement, giving the developers ample time to create solutions in accordance with the Competition Objectives. These objectives have been chosen based on the most popular and trendy solutions, highlighting the Super Protocol‚Äôs ability to tackle modern challenges even during the initial phase of the Testnet.

Participants stand to win 40K TEE Tokens in each Objective category and a grand prize of 10K USDC for the best of the best solution. We invite developers who are keen on exploring the future of Web3 and are competitive enough to participate in the Competition. Register now via the provided link to secure your spot in the competition: [[LINK]](https://superprotocol.typeform.com/pycompetition23)

 

Super Protocol Testnet Phase1 already allows you to deploy your own solutions by using CLI. 

Here is the CLI Video Guide, offering comprehensive instructions on setting up the CLI, creating and managing wallets, as well as interacting with the Super Protocol Testnet:  [[Guide] ‚ö°Ô∏è Super Protocol Testnet Phase1: CLI Scenario](https://youtu.be/xNL4gov99T8) 

### Key takeaways from the guide include:

‚ñ™Ô∏è The CLI is a command line interface application that enables interaction with the Super Protocol Testnet.

‚ñ™Ô∏è The guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing the CLI on different operating systems like Mac and Linux.

‚ñ™Ô∏è Once the CLI is set up, users can create and manage wallets for storing and managing Testnet assets.

‚ñ™Ô∏è The guide offers guidance on how to create new wallets, view wallet balances, and transfer assets between wallets.

‚ñ™Ô∏è Additionally, it provides instructions on how to interact with smart contracts on the Super Protocol Testnet, including deployment and calling contract functions.

The guide is well-detailed and includes examples for easy understanding, for more details you can check the [text CLI guide](https://docs.superprotocol.com/testnet/cli/) as well.

It is recommended to check Super Protocol [Whitepaper](https://docs.superprotocol.com/whitepaper/) for a deeper understanding of the infrastructure and the [WebUI guide](https://youtu.be/s61q-LfgEhY) for an easy understanding of the existing solutions

Furthermore, to be eligible to participate in the Python Competition, you will need to request Testnet access via the provided link: https://superprotocol.typeform.com/testnet

Results will be facilitated by the Super Protocol Team and winners will be chosen by the Super Protocol community to maintain an independent approach

 

‚úÖ **minimum requirements:**

‚ñ™Ô∏è **The application should output four generated images for each input phrase.**

‚ñ™Ô∏è  The application should take as input a phrase (dataset), which is located in the file ('INPUT_DIR')/input0001/phrase.txt

‚ñ™Ô∏è  The maximum size for the text file is 512 bytes. Codepage is ‚Äúutf-8‚Äù.

‚ñ™Ô∏è  The application should generate four pictures in jpg format:

('OUTPUT_DIR')/ai.gen01.jpg

('OUTPUT_DIR')/ai.gen02.jpg

('OUTPUT_DIR')/ai.gen03.jpg

('OUTPUT_DIR')/ai.gen04.jpg

**There are environment variables provided:** 

RUN_DIR = os.getenv('RUN_FOLDER') # here are the source texts of the application, incl. - /sp/run

INPUT_DIR = os.getenv('INPUT_DATA_FOLDER') # here is the result of the application - /sp/inputs

OUTPUT_DIR = os.getenv('OUTPUT_DATA_FOLDER') # input here is /sp/output

In addition, we are passing an environment variable PYTHONUSERBASE = "/sp/run/pypi", i.e. external libraries can be put next to the entrypoint.py script in the pypi folder.

The input datasets will be in the form of an offer, with 8 available during development and 2 opened during the final phase.

üëâ **Check it out and vote for it here in Discord:** https://discord.gg/superprotocol



## Results Submission
Upon the advent of the submission deadline, developers shall furnish access to the applications in the form of a resource comprising an encrypted file and TII, which will subsequently be utilized to process the order utilizing the mrEnclave feature. It is not necessary to make the code publicly available on platforms such as GitHub or other repositories, as the developer retains the option to keep the code confidential. Following the submission of the work, it is imperative that the developer notify the appropriate parties via the #pythoncompetition channel on the Discord communication platform. It should be noted that this channel is restricted to verified members of the Super Protocol Discord community.

‚ö†Ô∏è It is important to note that the developer retains ownership rights to the submitted solution's code. The primary objective of Super Protocol is to integrate developers into a decentralized confidential cloud ecosystem, providing them with the opportunity to monetize their solutions, rather than acquiring the solutions themselves.

**Important:**

For Competition Objective to be considered valid, it must have at least five competing entries. The objective will not be launched or will be rescheduled until 5 teams have committed. Applications in failed categories can be rescheduled or evaluated outside the program - the jury will consider cases separately

Developer/Team can create no more than one project in each category

As organizers, we reserve the right to remove a team/project/participant from participation without explanation




## Evaluation and Decision-Making Process for Competition Results

Upon notification of the deployment of the solution via the Discord server, a review of the results will be conducted to assess alignment with established criteria prior to eligibility for inclusion in the final evaluation process. A singular private key will be utilized for all orders, facilitating ease of access for all interested parties to verify the legitimacy of the results. The final stages of the competition will be facilitated through the creation of offers on the Super Protocol Testnet, specifically in the form of two data offers (phrase #9 and #10).

The final decision on the 2 winners and the Best solution will be decided by the community's. Voting will start on March 16, 2023 within the Discord community and on Twitter.

Once the final testing phase begins, any changes to the applications will no longer be allowed. Developers will provide access to the applications in the form of a resource to an encrypted file and TII, which will be used to process the order with the mrEnclave feature. The numbers of offers to complete will be provided at a later date closer to the final testing phase.

The results will be announced on April 1st. If you have any questions, feel free to ask our CMs in Discord, cause Pablo, Jami, Cat and Vince are 24/7 available and ready to support you.
